# KNN-AND-SVM-Accuracy-Prediction-by-using-ML
Hereâ€™s a short description for your KNN and SVM Machine Learning project: "This project explores the implementation and comparison of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms for classification tasks. It includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation using accuracy,precise
